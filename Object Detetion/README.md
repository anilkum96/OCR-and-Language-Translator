# Pre-trained model of Facebook DETR

This is the pre-trained model of Facebook DETR

We went through the papers and came to know DETR is good at detectin the objects, so we thought if we couldn't train our own model then will gonna use this pre-trained model of Facebook DETR.

As for now we donot have access to GPU so we are not able to train our own model which will give best result, so until then we are going to use this Pre-train model in our backend
