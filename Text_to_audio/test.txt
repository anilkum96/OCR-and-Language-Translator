OCR and Language Translator
Motivation:
Many researchers have focused on improving optical character recognition (OCR) efficiency by
developing new techniques using image processing-based methodologies. However, the major
limitations of image processing techniques are their complexity and computational intensity.
Thus, they are not applicable to some real-time application. This problem seems interesting to
me and my team, so we thought why don’t we spend some time and figure this out, how we
can improve the traditional OCR techniques. And there’s one extra thing which really drew
attention of my team towards improving OCR, i.e. Language translation. What if we really
obtain high accuracy on OCR , then using this improved version of OCR techniques we can
translate text obtained from OCR model to any language effectively. Though G-Translate app
has this feature but it’s not that much effective in the real time.
Project Description:
 Tools:
 → We are using python as a programming Language.
 → Tools for this project are, Deep Learning (CNN, NLP), TensorFlow, pyTorch.
Challenges:
 → We are doing OCR, object Detection and Language Translation, so main
challenge is the accuracy at the real time.


Deliverables:
➔ Final output is the text in the form of user desirable language. Suppose I am in Punjab
and I want to read the banner, then what I will do is, first click the picture of the banner,
and select the language that I want to convert the text in banner (say English), then I fed
the clicked image into the app, and our app will show the exact meaning of what is
written in that banner in English language.
➔ Main feature of our app will be the language translation, and we planned to add one
extra feature i.e. Object detection. So, our app will also detect the objects in the picture
and translate the meaning of that object into desirable language. Suppose I clicked
picture of bird, and now I want to know what does bird mean in Hindi, now I fed the
picture of bird into our app, and our app will show चिडिया.
➔ We are planning to do object detection and language translation at the very instant (in
the real time). I mean, user need not to click the image in order to translate, user will
just open the camera and focus on the banner or object and our app will do rest.
