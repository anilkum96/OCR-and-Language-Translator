# TEXT TO AUDIO

We are planning to integrate this Text to audio feature in or mobile and web app

And this is the demo of the Text to Audio convertor

Please look into [Lan_code.txt](https://github.com/ashish807/OCR-and-language-translation/blob/master/Text_to_audio/Lan_code.txt) for country code

After selecting the country code run [text_to_adio.py](https://github.com/ashish807/OCR-and-language-translation/blob/master/Text_to_audio/text_to_audio.py) file and put the country code 
and then you will be able to here the audio of whatever written in [test.txt](test.txt\) file
